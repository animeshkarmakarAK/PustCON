PustCON social networking site
Social networking –It’s the way the 21 st century communicates now. Social networking is the grouping of individuals into specific groups, like small rural communities or a neighborhood subdivision.  Although social networking is possible in person, especially in the workplace, universities and high schools.  It’s the most popular online. This is because unlike most high schools, colleges, or workplaces, the internet filled with millions of individuals who are looking to meet other people.

Social networking is the mapping and measuring of relationships and flows between people, groups, organization, computers, URL’s and other connected information /knowledge entities. The nodes in the network are the people and groups while the links show relationships of flows between the nodes. Social networking provides both a visual and a mathematical analysis of human relationships. 

Social networking website project itself is a huge project comprising various features like profile updating, friend’s list organization and various other application to enhance the overall look and feel of the website. However, in this project I am basically working on PROFILE MANAGEMENT, GROUP ORGANIZATION, POSTING ON GROUP, PRIVACY MANAGEMENT SETTINGS.

Educational status, basic status, contact info, address info, professional skills etc.
GROUP ORGANIZATION modules maintain the groups, scope to make group, add members in groups, suggest to join groups, request to join groups.
PRIVACY MAANGEMENT SETTIGNS this module maintain the users name, password, email, phone no. and give scope to modify these values.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The Web-based social networking services make it possible to connect people who share interests. Several websites are beginning to tap into the power of the social networking model for philanthropy. Such models provide a means for connecting otherwise fragmented industries and small organizations without the resources to reach a broader audience with interested users. Social networks are providing a different way for individuals to communicate digitally. Each user who wants to use this site must create a account . This is the head class. The account information has four purposes : hold the login information, hold profile information, privacy information, hold the groups information. This proposed system the privacy settings object contain all the privacy info and privacy settings. The main objective  and object of this system is making group and interacting people by group organization by posting and commenting users In the group to socializing.

CONCLUSION:
While developing the system a conscious effort has been made to create and develop a software package, making use of available tools, techniques and resources – that would generate a proper system for ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKING. While making the system, an eye has been kept on making it as user-friendly. As such one may hope that the system will be acceptable to any user and will adequately meet his/her needs. As in case of any system development process where there are a number of short comings, there have been some shortcomings in the development of this system also. There are some of the areas of improvement which couldn’t be implemented due to time constraints. One such feature was online chat where members can chat with his friends through this website and profile wall posting in etc.
